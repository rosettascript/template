# Scope: client, server, docker, docs, config, etc.
# Subject: imperative, start lower case, don't end with a period
# Body: Just as in <subject>, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# Footer: Breaking changes and issues closed

# Examples:
# feat(client): add user authentication
# fix(server): resolve database connection issue
# docs: update deployment guide
# style: format code with prettier
# refactor(api): simplify user service
# test: add unit tests for auth middleware

#
# BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication flow has been completely rewritten.
# Users will need to re-authenticate after this update.
