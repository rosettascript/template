# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to protect users until a fix is available.

### 2. Report via email

Please send an email to [rosettascript@gmail.com] with the following information:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: OS, Node.js version, dependencies, etc.
- **Proof of concept**: If applicable, include a minimal reproduction case

### 3. What to expect

- **Acknowledgement**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days

### 4. Disclosure timeline

- **Immediate**: Critical vulnerabilities affecting authentication or data integrity
- **7 days**: High severity vulnerabilities
- **30 days**: Medium severity vulnerabilities
- **90 days**: Low severity vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong JWT secrets (minimum 256 bits)
- Implement proper session management
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all user inputs

#### Data Protection
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Sanitize user inputs

#### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use `npm audit` regularly
- Remove unused dependencies
- Use lock files (package-lock.json)

#### Code Security
- Follow secure coding practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper error handling
- Log security events
- Use security headers

### For Deployment

#### Environment Security
- Use strong database passwords
- Secure database connections
- Use HTTPS certificates
- Configure firewalls properly
- Keep systems updated

#### Monitoring
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Set up log monitoring
- Use intrusion detection systems
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Track API usage patterns

## Incident Response

### If a vulnerability is discovered:

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Assess the severity and impact
   - Implement temporary mitigations if needed
   - Notify affected users if necessary

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze the root cause
   - Determine affected versions
   - Develop a fix

3. **Resolution**
   - Release a security patch
   - Update documentation
   - Communicate with users

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct a post-mortem
   - Update security procedures
   - Improve monitoring
