### üíª [Software Stack](./software-stack/)
Technology stack and dependencies
- Programming languages and frameworks
- Runtime environments and versions
- Third-party libraries and packages
- Development tools and IDEs
- Version control and CI/CD tools

### üóÑÔ∏è [Database](./database/)
Database requirements and design
- Database type and version
- Schema design requirements
- Performance and scalability needs
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Data migration requirements

### üåê [Networking](./networking/)
Network and connectivity requirements
- Bandwidth and latency requirements
- Network protocols and standards
- Security protocols (SSL/TLS, VPN)
- CDN and caching requirements
- API rate limiting and throttling

### üöÄ [Deployment](./deployment/)
Deployment and DevOps requirements
- Deployment environments (dev, staging, prod)
