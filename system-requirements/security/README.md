# Security Requirements

Security requirements define the **protection measures, compliance standards, and security controls** needed to safeguard the system, data, and users.

## Sub-categories

### üîê [Authentication](./authentication/)
User identity verification

## Common Security Standards

### Data Protection Regulations
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **PCI DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

### Security Frameworks
- **ISO 27001** (Information Security Management)
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **OWASP Top 10** (Web Application Security)
- **SOC 2** (Service Organization Control)

## Security Testing Requirements

### Vulnerability Assessment
- Automated security scanning
- Manual penetration testing
- Code security analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Infrastructure security assessment

### Compliance Testing
- Security control validation
- Compliance gap analysis
- Audit trail verification
- Policy adherence testing
- Regulatory requirement validation

## Best Practices

1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security
2. **Least Privilege** - Minimum necessary access
3. **Zero Trust** - Verify everything, trust nothing
4. **Security by Design** - Build security in from the start
5. **Regular Updates** - Keep security measures current
6. **Incident Response** - Plan for security incidents
7. **User Education** - Security awareness training
