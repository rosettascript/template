# System Requirements Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive system requirements organized by category. Each category represents a fundamental aspect of system requirements that must be considered for any application or system.

## Structure Overview

### ðŸ“‹ [Functional Requirements](./functional/)
**What the system must do**
- Core features and capabilities
- User interactions and workflows
- Business logic and rules
- Data operations and management
- Integration requirements

### âš¡ [Non-Functional Requirements](./non-functional/)
**How well the system must perform**
- Reliability and availability
- Maintainability and code quality
- Scalability and growth capacity
- Portability across platforms
- Interoperability with other systems

### ðŸ”§ [Technical Requirements](./technical/)
**Infrastructure and technology needs**
- Hardware and infrastructure specifications
- Software stack and dependencies
- Database requirements and design
- Networking and connectivity
- Deployment and DevOps requirements

### ðŸ”’ [Security Requirements](./security/)
**Protection and compliance needs**
- Authentication and authorization
- Data protection and encryption
- Network security measures
- Compliance with security standards
- Audit and monitoring

### ðŸ“Š [Performance Requirements](./performance/)
**Speed, scalability, and efficiency**
- Response time specifications
- Throughput and capacity requirements
- Resource usage limits
- Scalability metrics and targets
- Performance optimization strategies

### ðŸ”„ [Compatibility Requirements](./compatibility/)
**Platform and integration needs**
- Browser and device support
- Operating system compatibility
- API version requirements
- Third-party integrations
- Cross-platform considerations

### ðŸ‘¥ [Usability Requirements](./usability/)
**User experience and accessibility**
- User interface design standards
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG, ADA)
- User experience guidelines
- Internationalization support
- Help and documentation requirements

### ðŸ“œ [Compliance Requirements](./compliance/)
**Legal and regulatory standards**
- Legal requirements and obligations
- Industry-specific standards
- Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Audit requirements
- Regulatory compliance needs

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Start with Functional Requirements** - Define what the system must do
2. **Add Non-Functional Requirements** - Specify quality attributes
3. **Detail Technical Requirements** - Define infrastructure needs
4. **Include Security Requirements** - Ensure protection measures
5. **Specify Performance Requirements** - Set performance targets
6. **Define Compatibility Requirements** - Ensure broad support
7. **Plan Usability Requirements** - Focus on user experience
8. **Address Compliance Requirements** - Meet legal obligations

## Documentation Standards

- Use clear, measurable criteria
- Include acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Specify priority levels (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have)
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Include traceability to business objectives

## Review Process

- Requirements should be reviewed by stakeholders
- Technical feasibility should be validated
- Security implications should be assessed
- Performance impact should be evaluated
- Compliance requirements should be verified
